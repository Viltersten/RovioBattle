Rovio Backend Code Test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this test is to create a turn based combat simulation for an RPG.
The test should focus on clean and readable code architecture.

Requirements
- Written as a C# .Net Core console application.
- Print the combat flow/events to the console to display what happens in the simulation.
- Try to spend a maximum of 8 hours on the test.
- Unit tests should cover several combat scenarios.

Gameplay
- 2 characters take turns attacking each other
- Characters have a name
- Characters have 100 health
- Characters gains 2 energy per turn
- Characters have 4 abilities each:
	- Melee: It costs 0 energy and causes 3 damage
	- Fireball: It costs 1 energy and causes 5 damage
	- Ice bolt: It costs 2 energy and causes 10 damage
	- Poison: It costs 3 energy, causes 7 damage and then 4 damage each turn for 3 turns
- Each turn, a random ability is chosen and cast (if enough energy is accumulated)
- If there is not enough energy for the chosen ability, the character performs a melee attack
- After an attack has been performed, we print what happened in the console.
- If any character reaches 0 health, the simulation ends.

Bonus features
- Characters have a random chance to be equipped with a "passive ability" on startup.
- A passive ability can be:
	- Lucky pants: Has a 75% chance to evade melee attacks
	- Ring of flames: Boosts fire attacks by 100%
